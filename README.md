# MatchingEngine

This project acts as a "Trading Simulation".

Through the webapp (Flask backend, HTML/CSS/JS frontend), you can access multiple different stocks and trade with them. Each stock has its own inidividual wallet, and you can purchase shares for each one.

## What does this project actually do?

The purpose of this project was to make a makeshift trading platform from scratch; I've implemented the logic for matching buy vs sell trades, as well as enabling user input so that they can trade on the app, making the graphs load the current and previous trade data, and more.

It was good fun trying to work all of this out without much prior knowledge!
